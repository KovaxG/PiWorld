# PiWorld

- A village is made up of 4 villages when created
- Each villages can perform a task
- You can create new villagers by marrying up two villagers and waiting for a baby
- All villagers can have babies
- When a villager has a baby, that villager can not work for a given time
- The first 4 villagers have set names, but you can change the names of the babies
- There is a research minigame similar to doodle good, where you combine a number of resources to get a new resource (you loose resources by doing so)
- Towns usually have only 1 or 2 major resources nearby
- Towns need to trade between each other to gain technology and resources
- If a players gets conquered, if his villagers escape alive, they rally to a new place to create a new town
- If a player doesn't start a new town the villagers start to wonder about
- Villagers have skill points and other attributes
